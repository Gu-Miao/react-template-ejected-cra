# React Template Ejected CRA

[简体中文](./README_zh.md) | English

This is a template repo of `React`. Based on ejected `CRA@4`, I add some new features for the project so that you could use it easily. New features are shown below:

- Prettier and eslint support.
- Antd and import babel plugin.
- CHANGELOG template.
- Editor config.
- Independent config file for babel and eslint.
- Bunlde analzyer and speed plugin for webpack.
- Webpack alias (that's not a hard feature I think, but I really don't know why CRA didn't support it yet).
- Less support.
- Purge CSS plugin for webpack.
- Config router and cache router.
